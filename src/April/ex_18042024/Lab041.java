        // Casting means Molding

        // Implicit Casting--> where you can store smaller value container into big container
        // JVM will automatically do it you don't have to specify
        // below byte is small container we are storing it's value 10 in bigger container int ie; integer
        byte b = 10;
        int a = b;

        // Explicit Casting -  If you want to specifically tell JVM that you want to convert it into integer
        int a1 = (int) b;//  --> Explicit Casting

        //Explicit Casting:
        //When type casting is happening explicitly by the programmer then it is called as Explicit Casting.
        //There are two types of conversions:
        // Widening - Widening is the process of converting lower data type to higher type. This is safe conversion
        // Narrowing - Narrowing is the process of converting higher type to lower type
