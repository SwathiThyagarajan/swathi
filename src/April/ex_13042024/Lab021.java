        //In Java, reference types refer to objects rather than primitive data types.
        // A reference type variable stores the memory address of an object rather than the object itself.
        // This distinction is crucial for understanding how objects and data are managed in memory.

        /*
           Types of Reference Types
Class Types:

Instances of classes.
Example: String, custom classes like Person, Dog, etc.
Array Types:

Collections of elements of a single type.
Example: int[], String[], Person[].
Interface Types:

Variables can hold objects of any class that implements the interface.
Example: List<String>, Runnable.
Enumeration Types:

Special classes that represent a group of constants.
Example: enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, ... }.

        /*
                Literals are fixed values written directly in the code and can be of various types,
            including integers, floating points, characters, strings, booleans, and null.
            The `null` literal is used for reference types to indicate the absence of an object.
            Understanding these concepts helps in effectively working with variables and memory management in Java.
