         * Variables in Java are very strict thus they all must have a data type declared with their identifier
         * Variable name is called as identifier
         * There are three rules to create an identifier / Variable name:
         * 1.Characters from A to Z, as well as their lowercase counterparts, can be used.
         * 2.Numbers from 0-9 can be used.
         * 3.Special characters that can be used are $ (the dollar sign) and _ (underscore).
