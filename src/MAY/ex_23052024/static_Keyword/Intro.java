        Important Topics
        1.Static
        2.Wrapper class
        3. Java Exceptions
        4.Enum

        1.Static means it belongs to class
        // Static --> is a keyword
        // Static can be a --> Data member
        // Static can be a -->Function
        // Static can be a -->Class

        // Static loads when Class is loaded. -
        // The moment u load the class loaders static variables is also loaded in JVM

        Static Example:--
      * if u see a black board and there are 4 object persons
      * obj1 pramod has his own id, name,roll no. and address
      * similarly obj 2 amit, 3 and 4 have their own details
      * suppose somebody wrote a = 10, object 2 changed a = 20
      * latest value everyone sees is 20
      * above a belongs  to a class because all the objects are seeing the same value this is known as static
      - static basically means if u want something common across the objects then we will create satic

      Ex-2  Suppose ATB is a class, all of them will have different phone no.
            but, class name is same/common for everyone so we need to create class as static

            In Java, the static keyword is used for memory management mainly
            It used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
            It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes.
