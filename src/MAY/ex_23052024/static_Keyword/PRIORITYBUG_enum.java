//    Enum (PRIORITYBUG):
//    An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants
//    (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
//    PRIORITYBUG is an enum that defines four constants: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and CRITICAL.
//    Enums are used when you have a fixed set of related constants that can be logically grouped together.
