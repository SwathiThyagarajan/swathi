/*
     In Java, access modifiers are keywords that set the access level for classes, variables, methods, and constructors.
      There are four main access modifiers in Java:
      1. public
Class: A public class is accessible by any other class.
Field/Method/Constructor: A public member (field, method, or constructor) is accessible from any other class.

      2. protected
Field/Method/Constructor: A protected member is accessible within the same package and by subclasses,
 even if they are in different packages.

      3. default (package-private)
Class: A class with no access modifier is accessible only within the same package.
Field/Method/Constructor: A member with no access modifier is accessible only within the same package.

      4. private
Field/Method/Constructor: A private member is accessible only within the class it is declared in.


In programming, a "field name" typically refers to the name given to a variable that is declared within a class
