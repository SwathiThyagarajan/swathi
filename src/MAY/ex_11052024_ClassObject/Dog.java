public class Dog {

    //Attributes of Dog
    String name;
    String breed;
    int legs;
    String ear;


    //Behaviour
    void eat(){} // is this function or method
    void walk(){}// this is method because whenever a function is inside the class it is called as method
    void bark(){}

    // The above is just a blueprint to create a dog, it is not a real dog
    // real dog is created in lad 163

    // can I have a main function here??
    // yes it is possible but we generally avoid calling main function in same class so, we can reuse them
