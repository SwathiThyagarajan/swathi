/*    Inheritance

     Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java and object-oriented programming (OOP)
     that allows a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of an existing class.
     The primary purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability
     and establish a natural hierarchical relationship between classes.

     Key Concepts of Inheritance in Java:
Super Class (Parent Class): The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
                            It is also known as the base class or parent class.

Sub Class (Child Class): The class that inherits the properties and methods from another class.
                         It is also known as the derived class or child class.

extends Keyword: This keyword is used to denote inheritance.
                 The subclass uses the extends keyword to inherit from the superclass.

Benefits:
Code Reuse: Write common code once in the superclass and reuse it in subclasses.
Hierarchy: Create a natural parent-child relationship between classes.


       we have almost 5 types of Inheritance in java
       1. Single inheritance  - 80%
           A class inherits from one superclass. This is the most common type of inheritance.
       2. Multiple inheritance -10-5%

       3. Multilevel inheritance --10-5%
          A class inherits from another subclass, creating a chain of inheritance.
       4. Hierarchical inheritance - rarely used
       5. Hybrid inheritance - rarely used

       80% of times Single inheritance is used
